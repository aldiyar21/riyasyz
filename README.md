## About the project: 
Our group decided to choose the volunteering service as our project, because we believe that this topic is very relevant in our time and useful for society. We ourselves are interested in this topic and have repeatedly participated in volunteer movements within the framework of various programs and events.

Volunteering is an activity performed voluntarily for the benefit of society or individual social groups, without expectation of remuneration. Thus, volunteers become not for financial reasons, but for the sake of helping others and gaining invaluable life and professional experience. Nowadays, volunteering is becoming more and more common. Many people of different ages take an important step to try their hand at volunteering in order to take a fresh look at themselves and the world around them, learn something, get new acquaintances with interesting people.

At the moment, the volunteer movement in Kazakhstan is developing in such directions as:
• charity (helping to people in difficult life situations)
• development of education
• organization of public events: sports, cultural, educational, religious.
• holding exhibitions, master classes, lectures
• help to animal shelters

There are also 109 volunteer organizations in Kazakhstan. The most famous volunteer organizations in Kazakhstan are the League of Volunteers, Best for kids, "28 loops", "Club of kind people". Similar and other organizations work on a gratuitous basis, they provide assistance to people absolutely free of charge. Situations in life are different and they can help a person who finds himself in a temporary predicament in order to support him and so that he can get out of difficulties and start a new life.
